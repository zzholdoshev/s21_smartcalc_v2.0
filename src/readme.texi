This is a calculator app written for educational purposes. The distinctive feature of this calculator is that, unlike many other projects, it correctly calculates mod with negative numbers, and also has an auto-completion system (type "si" for sin(), "c" for cos(), etc). The calculator has the ability to plot graphs.
